Release Notes
=============

MongoDB Connector for Spark 10.2.0
----------------------------------

- Added the ``ignoreNullValues`` write configuration property, which enables you
  to control whether the connector ignores null values. In previous versions, 
  the connector always wrote ``null`` values to MongoDB.

MongoDB Connector for Spark 10.1.1
----------------------------------

- Corrected a bug in which aggregations including the ``$collStats`` pipeline stage
  did not return a count field for Time Series collections.

MongoDB Connector for Spark 10.1.0
----------------------------------

- Support for Scala 2.13.
- Support for micro-batch mode with Spark Structured Streaming.
- Support for BSON data types.
- Improved partitioner support for empty collections.
- Option to disable automatic upsert on write operations.
- Improved schema inference for empty arrays.
- Support for null values in arrays and lists. The Connector now writes these values
  to MongoDB instead of throwing an exception.
