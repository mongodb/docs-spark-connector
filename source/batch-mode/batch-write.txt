.. warning:: Setting the Write Mode to ``overwrite``

   If you specify the ``overwrite`` write mode, the connector drops the target
   collection and creates a new collection that uses the
   default collection options.
   This behavior can affect collections that don't use the default options,
   such as the following collection types:

   - Sharded collections
   - Collections with non-default collations
   - Time-series collections

.. important::

   If your write operation includes a field with a ``null`` value,
   the connector writes the field name and ``null`` value to MongoDB. You can
   change this behavior by setting the write configuration property
   ``ignoreNullValues``. For more information about setting the connector's
   write behavior, see :ref:`Write Configuration Options <spark-write-conf>`.
