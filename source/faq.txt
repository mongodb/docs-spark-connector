How can I achieve data locality?
--------------------------------

For any MongoDB deployment, the Mongo Spark Connector sets the
preferred location for an RDD to be where the data is:

- For a non sharded system, it sets the preferred location to be the
  hostname(s) of the standalone or the replica set.

- For a sharded system, it sets the preferred location to be the
  hostname(s) of the shards.

To promote data locality,

- Ensure there is a Spark Worker on one of the hosts for non-sharded
  system or one per shard for sharded systems.

- Use a :readmode:`nearest` read preference to read from the local
  :binary:`~bin.mongod`.

- For a sharded cluster, you should have a :binary:`~bin.mongos` on the
  same nodes and use :ref:`localThreshold <spark-input-conf>`
  configuration to connect to the nearest :binary:`~bin.mongos`. 
  To partition the data by shard use the 
  :ref:`conf-mongoshardedpartitioner`.

How do I interact with Spark Streams?
-------------------------------------

Spark streams can be considered as a potentially infinite source of
RDDs. Therefore, anything you can do with an RDD, you can do with the
results of a Spark Stream.

For an example, see :mongo-spark:`SparkStreams.scala
</blob/master/examples/src/test/scala/tour/SparkStreams.scala>`

How do I resolve ``Unrecognized pipeline stage name`` Error?
------------------------------------------------------------

In MongoDB deployments with mixed versions of :binary:`~bin.mongod`, it is
possible to get an ``Unrecognized pipeline stage name: '$sample'``
error. To mitigate this situation, explicitly configure the partitioner
to use and define the Schema when using DataFrames.

How do I use MongoDB BSON types that are unsupported in Spark?
--------------------------------------------------------------

Some custom MongoDB BSON types, such as ``ObjectId``\s, are unsupported 
in Spark.

The MongoDB Spark Connector converts custom MongoDB data types to and 
from extended JSON-like representations of those data types that are 
compatible with Spark. See :ref:`<bson-spark-datatypes>` for a list of 
custom MongoDB types and their Spark counterparts.

To create a standard Dataset with custom MongoDB data types, use 
``fieldType`` helpers:

.. code-block:: scala
   
   import com.mongodb.spark.sql.fieldTypes
 
   case class MyData(id: fieldTypes.ObjectId, a: Int)
   val ds = spark.createDataset(Seq(MyData(fieldTypes.ObjectId(new ObjectId()), 99)))
   ds.show()

To create DataFrames with custom MongoDB data types:

- Create RDDs using custom MongoDB BSON types 
  (e.g. ``ObjectId``). The MongoDB Spark Connector handles converting 
  those custom types into Spark-compatible data types.

- Declare schemas using the ``StructFields`` helpers for data types 
  that are not natively supported by Spark 
  (e.g. ``StructFields.objectId``). Refer to 
  :ref:`<bson-spark-datatypes>` for the data structure 
  underlying each custom MongoDB BSON type in Spark.

.. code-block:: scala
   
   import org.apache.spark.sql.Row
   import org.apache.spark.sql.types.{StructType, StructField, IntegerType}
   import com.mongodb.spark.sql.helpers.StructFields
 
   val data = Seq(Row(Row(new ObjectId().toHexString()), 99))
   val rdd = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(data)
   val schema = StructType(List(StructFields.objectId("id", true), StructField("a", IntegerType, true)))
   val df = spark.createDataFrame(rdd, schema)
   df.show()
